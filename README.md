## Description 

- Since the past two years, the world has been facing the global pandemic Covid-19. In India, when the situation was just beginning to stabilize we were hit harder with the 2nd wave. This time the distress was intensified with serious lack of oxygen, plazma, hospital beds, food, vaccination. 

- This made us realise the importance of a strong network which can be used to help each other out.

- On our website, people can create pages regarding the resources available for COVID to help people around them and share the links of those pages rather than repeatedly forwarding the same messages or posting them on their stories with a time limit/ word limit and with the information being unclear and improper.
